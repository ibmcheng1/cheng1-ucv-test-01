DEVELOPMENT_MODE_ENABLED_CWOBJ0047=CWOBJ0047I: Development mode is enabled for one or more map sets for data grids: {0}. For a production deployment, set the development mode attribute in the deployment policy file to false.
DEVELOPMENT_MODE_ENABLED_CWOBJ0047.explanation=Development mode allows primary and replica shards for the same partition to be placed on the same machine. When using one or two machines to develop code, this behavior is acceptable. However, when running in production, allowing placement of a primary and its replicas on the same machine risks data loss in case of whole machine failure.
DEVELOPMENT_MODE_ENABLED_CWOBJ0047.useraction=If you are in production phase or test phase consider changing development mode to false. The default is true. Otherwise, no action is required. See the Deployment policy descriptor XML file topic in the information center for more information about the developmentMode setting.

# Do not translate: WebSphere Application Server

# Do not translate: ObjectGrid, eXtreme Scale
DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_CWOBJ0059=CWOBJ0059I: The transaction timeout value was not configured or was set to 0 for ObjectGrid {0}. With this configuration, transactions never time out. The transaction timeout value is being set to 600 seconds.
DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_CWOBJ0059.explanation=eXtreme Scale does not recommend a configuration where transactions never time out. The transaction timeout value is overridden as 600 seconds.
DEFAULT_TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_CWOBJ0059.useraction=No action is required, or set an ObjectGrid transaction timeout value.

# Do not translate: JVM, ORB, eXtreme Scale
JVM_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_NOT_ORDERED_CWOBJ0060=CWOBJ0060W: The JVM shutdown hook is not ordered. The ORB shutdown hook might run before the eXtreme Scale shutdown hook runs. This might cause connectivity problems during the eXtreme Scale shutdown process.
JVM_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_NOT_ORDERED_CWOBJ0060.explanation=The eXtreme Scale shutdown hook must be the first shutdown hook to run. However, eXtreme Scale cannot guarantee it by reordering the JVM shutdown hook execution.
JVM_SHUTDOWN_HOOK_NOT_ORDERED_CWOBJ0060.useraction=Gather the FFDC text files, and contact IBM Software Support.

# {0} the transaction ID
# {1} thread id
# {2} shard ID (objectgridName:mapSetName:partitionID)
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_CWOBJ0061W=CWOBJ0061W: The transaction with TxID, {0}, that was last running on thread, {1}, on shard {2} has exceeded the configured transaction timeout value and was been marked rollback-only. This might be caused by lock contention or application deadlock, or your transaction timeout value is set too small.
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_CWOBJ0061W.explanation=WebSphere eXtreme Scale automatically marks a transaction rollback-only, when it has exceeded its configured transaction timeout value. This might be caused by lock contention or application deadlock, or your transaction timeout value is set too small.
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_CWOBJ0061W.useraction=Examine the application logic to determine whether a lock contention can be avoided. If a deadlock situation exists, remove that logic. If the transaction timeout value is too small and your application expects a long transaction, increase the transaction timeout value appropriately.

# {0} the transaction ID
# {1} the ObjectGrid name
# {2} shard ID (objectgridName:mapSetName:partitionID)
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_STATE_CWOBJ0066W=CWOBJ0066W: The {0} transaction has been marked rollback-only due to a state change of ObjectGrid {1} on shard {2} that forced transaction completion.  This might be caused by an administrator changing the availability state of the ObjectGrid instance or termination of the ObjectGrid instance.
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_STATE_CWOBJ0066W.explanation=eXtreme Scale automatically marks a transaction rollback-only when it does not end normally during some instances. When an administrator needs to quiesce activity to bring the data grid into the offline or preload state, if the transaction does not end normally in the allowed time, the transaction is marked rollback-only.
TRANSACTION_ROLLED_BACK_STATE_CWOBJ0066W.useraction=The administrator must wait for a period of inactivity to change the state of the data grid. Alternatively, you can manually end or put client applications and their transactions into an inactive state before you change the state of the data grid.

# Do not translate: ORB
# {0} ORB property
# {1} default setting
ORB_DEFAULT_PROPERTY_SET_CWOBJ0063=CWOBJ0063I: The {0} property was not configured. The {0} property is being set to {1}.
ORB_DEFAULT_PROPERTY_SET_CWOBJ0063.explanation=The listed property was not set in an orb.properties file. For some properties, if a value is not set for a timeout, it is set by the ORB to infinite and requests do not time out. The server sets a default value to allow requests to time out in the event of a problem. Other default settings are suggested starting points.
ORB_DEFAULT_PROPERTY_SET_CWOBJ0063.useraction=No action is required, or set a specific value. See ORB properties in the information center for more information about changing the ORB properties and values.

# Do not translate: SSL, JMX, JMXServicePort, JMXConnectorPort, JVM and -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
JMX_SSL_ENABLED_WITHOUT_PORT_CWOBJ0067W=CWOBJ0067W: SSL is enabled for JMX connections to this server. However, the JMXServicePort property was not provided.
JMX_SSL_ENABLED_WITHOUT_PORT_CWOBJ0067W.explanation=If SSL is configured for JMX, JMX communication does not work when communicating with this server over SSL if the JMXServicePort is not specified.
JMX_SSL_ENABLED_WITHOUT_PORT_CWOBJ0067W.useraction=Either provide the JMXServicePort and JMXConnectorPort properties when starting the server or disable SSL for the JMX protocol.  To disable SSL for the JMX protocol, either disable SSL for the server, or specify the JVM argument -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false during server startup to disable SSL only for JMX communication.

# Do not translate: MBeanServer, JMX and URL
JMX_SERVICE_URL_CWOBJ0068I=CWOBJ0068I: MBeanServer started with JMX URL {0}.

# Do not translate JVM, -Xmx,or -Xgcpolicy:balanced.
# {0} Maximum heap size limit.
# {1} Specified maximum heap size.
MAX_HEAP_WARNING_CWOBJ0071W=CWOBJ0071W: The maximum heap size of {1} bytes surpasses the recommended maximum heap size of {0} bytes.
MAX_HEAP_WARNING_CWOBJ0071W.explanation=As the heap size increases, garbage collection might cause performance degradation.
MAX_HEAP_WARNING_CWOBJ0071W.useraction=Reduce the maximum heap size allocated by using the JVM argument, -Xmx. The limit is 8 GB when you specify -Xgcpolicy:balanced in the JVM arguments and 5 GB for all other garbage collection policies.

COMMAND_RUNAS_SUBJECT_CWOBJ0072I=CWOBJ0072I: The WebSphere eXtreme Scale command runtime environment is using the {0} Subject RunAs type.
COMMAND_RUNAS_SUBJECT_CWOBJ0072I.explanation=When you run multiple partition commands, such as those used by AgentManager, the configured RunAs type is used.
COMMAND_RUNAS_SUBJECT_CWOBJ0072I.useraction=No action is required.

MISSING_CLASS_FOR_OPTIMISTIC_CALLBACK_CWOBJ0073E=CWOBJ0073E: WebSphere eXtreme Scale is unable to load the {0} class during deserialization. This class or a serializer for this class must be loadable by the eXtreme Scale runtime environment when you are using optimistic locking.
MISSING_CLASS_FOR_OPTIMISTIC_CALLBACK_CWOBJ0073E.explanation=When you are using optimistic locking, the default behavior is for the container server to check that the value was not updated. This check calls the equals method on the deserialized object. When you are using COPY_TO_BYTES copy mode, the class for the object might not exist on the container server.
MISSING_CLASS_FOR_OPTIMISTIC_CALLBACK_CWOBJ0073E.useraction=Use one of the following actions to resolve the error: (1) Package the specified class and any dependent classes so the container server can load the classes. (2) Package a serializer plug-in to deserialize data. (3) Use the built-in NoVersioningOptimisticCallback plug-in for this map. (4) Change the locking type to a type other than optimistic locking.

NO_IP_WAS_HOST_CWOBJ0074=CWOBJ0074E: No IP address for WebSphere end point host \"{0}\" could be found.  The catalog server ObjectGrid runtime will not start properly.
NO_IP_WAS_HOST_CWOBJ0074.explanation=Resolving the WebSphere defined host value is a requirement before starting the ObjectGrid runtime.
NO_IP_WAS_HOST_CWOBJ0074.useraction=Review the IBM ObjectGrid internet support web site for a similar problem or contact IBM service.
